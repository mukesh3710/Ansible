# High Level Steps

**1. Dynamic Inventory Script**

* A Python script will interact with the ServiceNow CMDB to retrieve host data.
* The script will filter the data based on specific CMDB fields:
    * `install_status`
    * `u_state`
    * `os`
    * `host_name`
    * `u_pool`
* The script will generate JSON output compatible with the Ansible dynamic inventory format.

**2. Ansible Automation Platform Integration**

* Utilize the dynamic inventory script within the Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).
* Schedule the script to run daily within AAP to ensure the inventory remains up-to-date.

**3. Grouping and Patching Logic**

* Group servers for patching based on the values of `u_pool` and `os`.
* Execute patching tasks according to these groups during predefined patching windows.

**4. Implementation Steps**

* Write the Python script for dynamic inventory retrieval and filtering.
* Configure AAP to use the generated dynamic inventory.
* Create Ansible playbooks and job templates for automated patching tasks. 

**Note:** This outline provides a high-level overview of the process. Detailed implementation will vary depending on specific requirements and the complexity of the environment.
